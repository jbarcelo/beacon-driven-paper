% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

\usepackage{psfrag}



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Organizing multi-hop wireless networks medium access control is a challenge due to the presence of the hidden node problem.
It requires reliable coordination among neighbours and second-hop neighbours.
In this paper we propose the construction of a collision-free beacon schedule that can be a first step towards the orchestration of effective medium access.
The construction process involves iterative trial and error until a collision-free schedule is found.
The participating nodes will keep changing the schedule until all the beacons are successfully received.
At this point, the nodes simply keep repeating the successful schedule.

%\boldmath
%In this paper we use a Markov Chain to model a simple solver for Decentralized Constrain Satisfaction problems.
%We provide closed-form expressions to compute the transition probabilities and the transition probabilities matrix can then be used to determine the expected number of steps that the system requires to converge to a solution.
%We use a protocol to allocate channel slots to contending stations as an illustrating example, and extend our model to contemplate the possibility of channel errors.
%The model is validated by means of simulation and we show that it can be easily extended to account for the presence of errors.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,

% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

% \IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this paper we discuss a family of protocols that can be used for radio resource assignment in wireless networks.
% The problem of assigning resources in a distributed fashion is defined as a Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction (DCS) problem \cite{duffy2011dcs}.
% We consider a particular solver for this family of problems that works iteratively, in several rounds, to find a solution to the problem.

% The solver performs a stochastic search until it converges to a solution.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

\IEEEPARstart{M}{edium} access in multi-hop wireless mesh networks is complicated by the fact that not all the stations are in each other's transmissions range.
Therefore is no longer possible to rely on Carrier Sense Multiple Access to coordinate the access to the medium.
It is likely that transmissions overlap and interfere with each other.
A completely random MAC protocol will not offer satisfactory performance.
Some kind of coordination among neighboring nodes is needed.

In this paper, we propose the initial construction of a collision-free schedule of beacons.
This process has to be decentralized as it takes place before the network is operative, which means that the participating stations can exchange data only with their neighbors.
The construction of the schedule is an iterative trial-and-error process that continues until a collision-free schedule of beacons is built.
At that point, it is possible for the nodes to reliable exchange information and transmit data with success guarantees.



\section{The Construction of the Collision-Free Schedule}

\subsection{Assumptions}
We model the network topology as a graph.
In the topology graph, the nodes represent wireless stations and the arcs between two nodes mean that those nodes can communicate with each other.
For illustration purposes, we will use the ring topology in Fig.~\ref{fig:topology}.

If a node has two neighbours transmitting simultaneously, it is assumed that that particular node cannot decode either of the transmissions.
For example, assume that at a given point of time nodes $F$ and $B$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:topology} are active.
Node $A$ will be unable to recover the transmissions.

Note that collisions occur at reception.
The fact that a collision occurs at $A$ when $F$ and $B$ simultaneously transmit does not mean that $E$ or $C$ cannot recover those messages, even though they overlap in time.
A transmission may collide in one receiver and be successful in another one.

A node can only detect and receive the transmissions of its immediate neighbours, and only if there is a single neighbour is active for the whole duration of the transmission.


This graph model represents strong assumptions because, in reality, wireless propagation is much more complicated.
The carrier sense range exceeds the transmission range and there is capture effect.
There are a large number of factors that determine whether a transmission is successful or not.
Nevertheless, for tractability, we use the above described graph model.

We also consider synchronization out of the scope of the present paper.
Even though beacons can be used to synchronize the network, we will not cover the initial synchronization of clocks and posterior clock drifts.


\subsection{A Beacon Schedule}
A recurrent solution in wireless networks is the use of broadcast beacons for synchronization and signaling.
Beacon messages are very short, which means that the likelihood of collisions is lower.
This beacons can be very useful for network coordination and management.

A schedule of beacons defines special times in which beacons can be transmitted.
Let us assume that beacons should be transmitted every $T_b$ seconds.
We will name each of the time instants at which a beacon can be transmitted a \emph{spot}.
Each spot can be either empty, successful or collision.
Note that, again, the perception of the spot depends on the position of the station in the topology.
For a given slot, it may happen that one station detects it as empty, another station as successful and another station as collision.

Then, it is also necessary to define a schedule length $S$ which is the number of spots.
Each station transmits a beacon once in every schedule in one of the $S$ allowed spots.
When the schedule is over, it is repeated again.
The length of the schedule in time units is simply $T_s=S*T_b$.

An example of a beacon schedule is represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:timeline}.
The axis represents time and each of the shaded blocks represents an spot in which beacon transmissions occur.
The dotted box is a spot in which no transmission occur.

%Note that the starting and ending position of the schedule is only of local significance. 
%We take the convention that each node considers the initial position of the schedule the one in which it has transmitted, and is numbered as zero.

A beacon includes acknowledgement information for all the beacons received by the station in the last schedule.
When a station $A$ receives beacons from all its neighbors confirming that they have received the beacon of station $A$, this station can assume that its beacon has not suffered any collision.

The challenge is to construct a schedule in such a way that all the stations can hear the beacons of all their neighbours.
When such schedule is successfully constructed, all the nodes will receive confirmation of successful reception of its beacon from all neighboring stations.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Interference Graph}
From the topology graph we derive the interference graph.
In the interference graph, there is an arc between two nodes if the simultaneous transmission of those two nodes results in interference.
Given the interference graph, the problem finding the collision-free schedule of beacons reduces to a map coloring problem.

We are interested in solving this problem in a decentralized way, as there is no central entity that has the global vision of the network and can magically configure all the nodes.
Only \emph{after} the problem has been solved, the network will work and it would be possible for a central point to gather all the information and remotely configure the nodes.

In order to solve this problem in a decentralized way, we need that the nodes keep trying different spots (or colours) until a solution is found.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Construction of a Beacon Schedule}

The goal is to create a schedule of beacons is collision-free and transmitted repeatedly.
This means that two different problems need to be solved in parallel.
The first one is to decide when the schedule starts and ends.
All the nodes see a succession of spots, but they do not know which is the fist one of the schedule and which is the last one.
The second problem is that each of the nodes have to pick one spot of the agreed schedule in such a way that no interference occurs.

For the first problem, a technique similar to the Spanning Tree Protocol root election can be used.
In our problem, we want the network to distributively elect a leader that decides when the network starts and ends.
For this purpose, each node has a value which consists of to fields. The first one is administratively configured and the second one is the MAC address of the device.
These two fields are concatenated into a single priority field.
The station with the lowest priority field will lead the network.

At the beginning, each station thinks of itself as the leader of the network, and broadcasts its priority field in the beacons. 
When a station receives a beacon with a priority field lower than its own, it recognizes that the lead is another station. 
In response to this finding, the station adjusts to the schedule beginning and end of the newly received beacon and it in the next beacon it broadcasts the value that it has received and was lower than its own.

For example, station $A$ transmits its beacon in position 0 of its schedule, and has a priority field 7f:08:9e:01:89:67:72.
In position 3 or its schedule it receives a beacon with a priority field 00:60:36:dd:7f:69:ee announcing that it is spot 4.
Then, station $A$ adjusts its state variables so that it is in state 4, it transmits in state 1 and announces 00:60:36:dd:7f:69:ee.
This mechanism ensures that the schedule pace of the lead station is propagated through the network.

To solve the second problem, an approach similar to \cite{barcelo2008lba} is used.
A station starts by picking a random spot in the schedule.
In the next schedule, it will 

%Each station picks a random spot in the schedule.
%If it receives confirmation from all of its neighbors, it assumes that no collisions have occurred and keeps transmitting at that position.
%This means that no other neighbor in the two-hop neighborhood has picked the same color.
%In this case, the station will defer the transmission of the next beacon a deterministic number of spots equal to the schedule length $S$.

%If a node in the two-node neighborhood pick the same color, the node that is a common neighbor of both will not receive the beacon and therefore will not confirm the correct reception.
%In this case, the station will defer the transmission of the next beacon a random number of spots.
%A sensible choice is to use an uniform variable between 1 and $2S$ so that the expectation of the random variable roughly coincides with the deterministic backoff used by successful stations.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Included in the Beacons}
In order to construct the collision-free schedule of beacons and facilitate subsequent data transmission, it is necessary to include some signaling information.
For each spot of the schedule, the stations reports two different values: the beacon that has been received in that spot (if any) and the number of packets ready to send to that particular destination.

For example purposes we imagine that $A$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:topology} in its second transmission in Fig.~\ref{fig:timeline} has correctly received the beacons from its neighbours $B$ and $F$, and has two outstanding packets for $B$ in its queues.
Then, the data information in the beacon includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Position 1: empty beacon
\item Position 2: acknowledgement for beacon B, 2 outstanding packets for B
\item Position 3: acknowledgement for beacon F, 0 outstanding packets for F
\end{itemize}

Additionally, each station also includes beacons for all the received data packets since the last beacon by that station.
This is a difference with respect to typical IEEE 802.11 implementation in which data acknowledgement is sent right after the correct reception.
As the acknowledgement is sent by the receiver of the data, it interferes with different transmissions than the original data.
These short acknowledgement packets can have devastating effects if they destroy a long data packets.
Furthermore, the acknowledgement requires a short inter-frame interval to account for the round-trip time and the time required for the hardware to switch from reception to transmission.
Channel time fragmentation is explained in \cite{barcelo2013dcc}
For these reasons, it is better to delay the transmission of the acks and send them all together in the beacon.

\subsection{The Medium Access Control Protocol}
Each station owns the time that follows its beacon until the next beacon spot.
It can use this time to transmit packets to its neighbours and to request packets from its neighbours using \emph{poll} packets.
When the station is finished with transmitting and receiving packets, it sends a short \emph{done} packet that allows its neighbours to contend for the medium using CSMA/ECA.

The medium is also open for contention after \emph{free} beacon spots.
A station that detects that one of the beacon spots is not use for its neighbours can use CSMA/ECA to send packets to its neighbours.

\subsection{An Example}
An example of medium access is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:medium-access}.
It shows the access to the medium from the point of view of station A.
After transmitting its beacon, station A is free to transmit and request packets from and to its neighbours.
In this particular example A transmits a packet to A and then a packet to B.
Then, it uses its remaining time to request and receive two packets from A.
The two packets are requested in the poll message.

The next beacon spot is free from A's point of view.
Therefore A can contend for the medium using CSMA/CA and in this transmission it is exposed to the hidden terminal interference.

Even though it is not shown in the figure, at a later time B transmits its beacon. 
Then A has to remain silent unless B explicitly requests a packet from A using a poll.

\section{Related Work}
A first attempt of a collision-free MAC protocol for multi-hop wireless networks appeared in \cite{barcelo2013dcc}.
That solution does not use beacons, and therefore the convergence is slower and the efficiency is lower.

An initial step in the direction we are exploring in this later was taken in \cite{cano2013iri}.
In that paper, the construction of a collision-free schedule is studied for a sensor network.
That paper focused on a simple scenario in which all nodes could hear each other transmissions.
Another difference between that paper and the present letter is that here we not aim to compute a schedule length which is similar or equal to the participating nodes.
In the present letter the schedule is independently computed by each node and therefore it is possible that different nodes use different schedule lengths.

The distributed coloring of graphs has been studied in \cite{checco2012lbc} which also considered the possibility of sensing restrictions.
In the present work we do not consider such sensing restrictions.
Another difference is that in the present work the beginning and ending of the schedule is different for different nodes, and even the schedule length can be different for different nodes.

\subsection{IEEE 802.11s Mesh Beacon Collision Avoidance}
A Mesh Beacon Collision Avoidance (MBCA) is described in \cite{hiertz2007pis}.
The solution consists of sometimes delaying the beacon transmission to check for possible overlapping transmissions among the one-hop neighbours.
It also involves including information about the timing of beacons in beacons.

This approach has some shortcomings. 
It does not prevent that two-hop neighbors choose overlapping beacon transmitting instants.
The timing information in beacons is available only in case of successful transmission and reception.
In the critical case in which collisions occurs and timing information is needed, it is not available.
Delaying the beacon sometimes seems also problematic. 
It is not impossible that the two colliding beacons choose to delay simultaneously and therefore the collision is not detected.
If the beacons are not delayed very frequently, it takes a long time to detect the collision.
If the beacons are delayed frequently, additional randomness is introduced that can easily result in more collisions.



\section{Discussion}
The proposed protocol has some shortcoming such as requiring periodical beacons that fragment and consume channel time, the possibility of unfairness if different nodes choose different schedule length, and the requirement for the stations to hold the packets longer in their queues due to the delayed acknowledgements.
Nevertheless, the protocol also offers interesting aspects.
In particular, each station owns a fraction of the channel time in which it can transmit without contention and without hidden problems.
The reserved channel time that is not consumed is freed for so that other stations can use it.

%\end{figure}
%
%To illustrate the underlying idea we will use a simple example involving $N=3$ different stations choosing among $B=4$ different slots.
%We assume that the number of stations deterministically choosing its transmission slot is $d=0$ and we are interested in computing the probability that exactly $\delta=1$ station succeeds.
%
%There are a total of $B^N=4^3$ outcomes that are represented as black dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:counting}.
%Each outcome is equally likely with probability $1/64$.
%The figure also shows three events $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$.
%The first event, $A_1$ represents the outcomes in which the first station succeeds.
%Similarly, the other two events, $A_2$ and $A_3$, represent the outcomes in which station 2 and 3 succeed, respectively.
%These sets are partially overlapping.
%Note also that it is impossible that two stations succeed while the third station collides.
%
%If we want to compute the probability that exactly one station succeeds, we have to count the outcomes that belong to either $A_1$, $A_2$ or $A_3$ and are not part of the intersections.
%This is $|A_1|+|A_2|+|A_3|-2(|A_1\cap A_2|+|A_1\cap A_3|+|A_2\cap A_3|)+3(|A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3|)$.
%In our paper we will use the intermediate values
% $S(1)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)$,
% $S(2)=P(A_1\cap A_2)+P(A_1\cap A_3)+P(A_2\cap A_3)$, and $S(3)=P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)$.
% The probability that exactly one station succeeds is finally computed  as $S(1)-2S(2)+3S(3)$.
